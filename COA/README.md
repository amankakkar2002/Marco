First of all, copy your old files in a backup folder, so that if anything fails you have your old files as a backup.

STEP 01 - Copy paste the code of **Print COA button.al** file into your code base.

STEP 02 - Copy paste the code of **COA REPORT.AL** file into your code base.

STEP 03 - Copy paste the layout file - **COAReport.Layout.rdl**

STEP 04 - Change the below mentioned path of layout in your codebase to where you have pasted the layout file. In my VS Code, I had a folder named src, in which I created a folder named COA, there I created this file.

In your case, if you paste the file in root of your codebase, just set the path as "./COAReport.Layout.rdl".
